### Sample Data (if seeded)
- **Instructor Account**: `username: instructor1`, `password: testpassword`
- **Student Accounts**: `username: student1`, `password: testpassword` and `username: student2`, `password: testpassword`

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Backend
- **Python 3.9+**: Chosen for its readability, extensive libraries, and strong community support
- **Django 5.x**: Full-featured web framework providing robust ORM, admin interface, and security features
- **Django REST Framework**: For building RESTful APIs with serialization, authentication, and permissions
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for development (easily switchable to PostgreSQL for production)

#### Frontend
- **Bootstrap 5**: Modern CSS framework for responsive design and consistent UI components
- **Bootstrap Icons**: Icon library for consistent visual elements
- **Google Fonts**: Typography enhancement for better readability
- **Server-side rendering**: Django templates for SEO-friendly, fast-loading pages

#### Authentication & Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication for API endpoints
- **Session Authentication**: Traditional Django session-based auth for web interface
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Django CSRF protection for form security
- **Role-based Access Control**: Custom decorators for instructor/student permissions

#### File Handling
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library for image processing and validation
- **Django File Storage**: Secure file upload handling with validation
